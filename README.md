# House Price Prediction Data Science
This is a data science project for predicting house prices using machine learning techniques. The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle's House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques competition.

Project Description
The goal of this project is to predict house prices based on various features such as the number of bedrooms, the size of the house, and the location of the property. The project is divided into the following stages:

Data exploration and cleaning: The dataset is examined to identify missing values, outliers, and other data quality issues. Data cleaning techniques are applied to address these issues.

Feature engineering: Additional features are derived from the existing ones to improve the predictive power of the model.

Model selection and tuning: Different machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost are trained and tested on the dataset. Hyperparameter tuning is performed to improve the performance of the models.

Model evaluation: The performance of the models is evaluated using various metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R-squared.

Getting Started
To get started with the project, clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com<senaemirler>/house-price-prediction.git
Then, install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
To run the project, navigate to the root directory and run the following command:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
This will train and evaluate the models and produce a file containing the predicted house prices.

Results
The best performing model achieved an RMSE of 0.12 and an R-squared value of 0.90. The model can be used to predict house prices with a high degree of accuracy.
